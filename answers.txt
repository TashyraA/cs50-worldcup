Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: None were proved incorrect, the higher the simulations, the longer time it takes for it to compute.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: It would be over 1000000 for it to be considered "good enough"
